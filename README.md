# ink-book

This digital book was started as a University project and is highly\
inspired by ink's own documentation - [Writing with ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md).

You can find live link to the project [here](https://ivanov1234159.github.io/ink-book/).

The book is not finished, yet (even the design - can't tell that should be a book),

If you deside to clone the repo, you may refer to these three valuable resources:

- [Running your ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/RunningYourInk.md) - how to actually use ink outside of the official ink editor [inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky);
- [inkjs](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs) - the JavaScript package that provides a runtime and a compiler for the ink stricting language;
    - note: it's not intended for browser use, thus `inkjs.PosixFileHandler` cannot work asynchronously
- [ink's main repository](https://github.com/inkle/ink)
